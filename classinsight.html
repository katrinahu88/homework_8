				<h3>Goal</h3>
				<p>Improving classroom learning by encouraging teacher immediacy behaviors through persuasive content and data design.</p>
				</br>
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>ClassInSight is a project conducted through the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

				This project uses classroom technology developed at Carnegie Mellon. It uses sensors to capture anonymized student and teacher nonverbal data, such as their location in the classroom, body position, and gaze.</p>

				<h3>Thematic Analysis</h3>
				<p>Our first task was to do a thematic analysis of the interviews conducted with the teachers (consisting of teaching faculty, tenured faculty, and teaching assistants). In these interviews, teachers were shown their nonverbal behavior data in the classroom, including data on their location within the classroom and their gaze (% of class time that they were looking at students, their notes, the board, etc.). In these interviews, teachers discussed the reasonings behind their data, other data they wish they had access to, and their goals for improving classroom ‚Äúimmediacy‚Äù behaviors. Immediacy is defined as a teacher's perceived psychological closeness to students that leads to students' improved engagement.
				We generated common themes that came up repeatedly within the interviews and coded approximately 25 interviews using these themes.</p>

				<h1>INTERVIEW</h1>
			</div>
			<div id="classinsightText">
				<h3>1. Teachers are interested in student data</h3>
				<p>Specifically, teachers are interested in different aspects of student engagement, attentiveness and focus in the classroom. They also want to know how changing their behaviors can impact or influence student behavior and learning.</p>
				</br>
				<h3>2. Teachers expressed an interest and desire to improve.</h3>
				<p>Throughout the interviews, teachers brainstormed goals that they would like to achieve, and changes that they could implement to achieve those goals. Examples include: using more mobile technology, moving around more, rearranging furniture.</p>
				</br>
				<h3>3. Physical and technological challenges are barriers to behavior change.</h3>
				<p>Some teachers claimed that physical barriers, such as furniture or classroom layout, inhibit or encourage teachers to stand or sit at specific locations. Many others attributed their location to technological barriers. For example, having their laptop at the podium forces them to stand behind the podium throughout class.</p>

				<h3>Sketching</h3>
				<p>Next, our team brainstormed ideas and sketches on how to best represent the data teachers were interested in. Our goal across these visualizations was to test ways of presenting information in a motivating way. This involved modulating how "quantified" the data appears, and testing flexible benchmarks which enable teachers to understand their performance yet adjust them based on their circumstances and goals.</p>

				<h3>Initial Iterations</h3>
				<p>We then began implementing out sketches into Figma, and created some initial iterations of a dashboard. We choose to include a heatmap of the classroom from a birds-eye view, and iterated on this idea to include both student and teacher data.</p>

				<h3>User Testing Feedback</h3>
				<p>We then conducted user testing sessions with over 20 professors within Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science. Most professors found our heat map design helpful in examining their classroom data. One common suggestion was finding a way to connect temporal and spatial data, since our current design does not.</p>
				</br>
				<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
				<p>We plan to iterate on our design, explore more data visualizations, and continue to build a more complete dashboard for teachers.</p>
